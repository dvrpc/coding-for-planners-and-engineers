# Version Control

As you write your code, you should commit your changes to a `git` repository and push
to GitHub.
Ideally each commit should contain a single working feature and not a million changes.
Each commit should be accompanied by a clear and concise message about the change.

When it comes to working with `git`, there's a few choices:

- Use the command-line-interface (CLI)
- Use a standalone graphical-user-interface (GUI)
- Use a GUI that's integrated into your IDE

As long as you're properly using the features of `git`, no approach is inherently better. The GUI options provide an easier method of previewing changes you've made
to a file, while the CLI option may be more efficient for power users.
